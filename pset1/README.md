For Problem 7, number of training datapoints is 10. Training 1000 different classifiers took on average 9.053 steps to converge.

For Problem 8, used the classifiers trained with 10 datapoints previously, and tested the performance on 5000 generated test-points (with the same target-function that was used to generate the original training points). The misclassification of the 1000 different classifiers was on average 0.11.

In total, Problem 7+8's test code took 28.5s on Intel-Core i7 processor.

For Problem 9, number of training datapoints is 100. Training 1000 different classifiers took on average 121 steps to converge.

For Problem 10, used the classifiers trained with 100 datapoints previously, and tested the performance on 5000 generated test-points (with the same target-function that was used to generate the original training points). The misclassification of the 1000 different classifiers was on average 0.013.

In total, Problem 9+10's test code took 1min 8s on Intel-Core i7 processor.
